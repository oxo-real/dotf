# sway hardware configuration setup

## the general sway config is in:		$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sway/config
## the external hardware configuration is in:	$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sway/hw/dev/ext
## the specific hardware configuration is in:	$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sway/hw/dev/foo
## which is called via symlink:			$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sway/current


# guide

after os installation change symlink current ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sway/current)
so that it points to the correct hardware configuration with:

ln -s -f $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sway/dev/foo $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sway/current

OR

if you have a machine_list use select_current_machine to change the symlink automatically

a machine list is a space separateed list that contains: product_serial machine_name


# detailed explanation

## $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sway/config includes the symlink:
"
# system identity
## change symlink for specific system config
include $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sway/current
"
so that the config calls the current machine sway specific hardware configuration


## current machine sway specific hardware configuration
contains the machine specific hardware for the sway configuration on the current machine

and

it calls $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sway/dev/ext
for the external hardware configuration
